# TimeRanks

Rank progression system based on user playtime.

Yes, it has been updated for the latest version of TShock. You are very welcome :)

Commands:
- /check <optional: username> (checks playtime)
- /rreload (reloads TimeRanks configuration file, does not currently have any message output)
- /rankdelete <username> (deletes a user from the TimeRanks db, essentially resetting their playtime)
