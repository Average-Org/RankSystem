# TimeRanks

Rank progression system based on user playtime. This plugin is intended for Average's Terraria Freebuild. Switch branches to get the Average's Survival plugin (required for Av's Survival Base)

Yes, it has been updated for the latest version of TShock5. You are very welcome :)

Commands:
- /check <optional: username> (checks playtime)
- /rreload (reloads TimeRanks configuration file)
- /rankdelete <username> (deletes a user from the TimeRanks db, essentially resetting their playtime)
